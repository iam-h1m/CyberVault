## Overview

CyberVault is a user-friendly vulnerability scanner designed specifically for non-technical users. It scans Windows systems for installed software, identifies potential security vulnerabilities (CVEs), and presents the findings in an accessible format with clear recommendations for remediation. The application also includes cybersecurity news updates to keep users informed about the latest security trends and best practices.

## Features

- **Simple, Intuitive Interface**: Designed from the ground up for non-technical users with clear navigation and visual feedback
- **Comprehensive Software Detection**: Automatically scans the Windows Registry to identify installed applications
- **CVE Vulnerability Matching**: Identifies known vulnerabilities in detected software using the National Vulnerability Database
- **Severity Classification**: Visually represents vulnerability severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) with color-coded indicators
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provides clear guidance on how to address identified vulnerabilities
- **Detailed PDF Reports**: Generates comprehensive, non-technical reports explaining findings and recommended actions
- **Cybersecurity News Feed**: Displays the latest cybersecurity news and updates
- **Offline Database Support**: Functions without an internet connection using cached vulnerability data

## System Requirements

- Windows 10 or newer
- 4 GB RAM (minimum)
- 300 MB disk space for installation
- Internet connection  

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/B00156808/CyberVault/releases) page

## Technical Architecture

CyberVault uses a modular architecture with three main components:

1. **Frontend**: PyQt5-based GUI with Matplotlib data visualizations
2. **Backend**: Windows Registry scanner, CVE matching engine, and ReportLab PDF generator
3. **Database**: Local SQLite database of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) with remote update functionality
